# Go-to-Hell-Dale-Repository
Go To Hell, Dale is a 2D platformer that is loosely based on the classic Dante's Inferno (Divine Comedy.) You play as Dale, a fatass coffee delivery man that has to make a delivery to Satan. Play through all circles of a very nice version of hell with such bosses as Reverse-berus, a 3-assed reimagining of Cerberus.
